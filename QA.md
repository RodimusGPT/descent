# Human visual QA checklist

The agent cannot self-certify visual correctness. This file lists what a human must
eyeball, per part/interactive. Exercise interactives in isolation at `/dev/<slug>`, and
in context at `/parts/<slug>`. Re-run with **reduced motion** on (OS setting) to confirm
static fallbacks still teach.

Legend: ☐ to check · each item names where to look.

## M0 — Scaffold & spine

**The spine — single continuous descent (`/`)**
- ☐ Is the whole thing ONE scrollable page (hero → six parts), and does scrolling it end-to-end
  *feel* like a descent rather than a set of separate pages?
- ☐ `ProgressRail` (desktop, left sidebar): are all six labels always visible, is the section
  in view highlighted, and does the warm fill descend as you scroll? Clicking a label jumps to
  that section (smooth, or instant under reduced motion).
- ☐ Mobile / narrow window: does the slim top bar show a progress line + a working "jump to part"
  dropdown? (The side rail is desktop-only by design.)
- ☐ Hero: does it read well, and does "Begin the descent ↓" jump to Part 0?
- ☐ Part accents: model parts (1, 2) tinted purple, hardware part (4) teal, neutral amber —
  visible in each section's "Part N · Title" eyebrow and the rail dots.

**Step-through navigator (the control, bottom-center)**
- ☐ Do **◀ Prev / Next ▶** move you one stop at a time (each beat + section), at your own pace?
  Does the visual + rail advance with each step?
- ☐ Does the **"n / N" counter** track your position as you also scroll freely by hand?
- ☐ Optional **auto-play** (▷): does it advance hands-free, and does any manual scroll / wheel /
  arrow key instantly stop it? Does the speed chip (1×/1.5×/2×/0.5×) change the pace?
- ☐ Reduced motion: do steps jump **instantly** instead of gliding?

**`ScrollScene` primitive (visible in every part's placeholder scene)**
- ☐ Sticky visual pane stays put while narration scrolls; the active step's narration is
  full-opacity, others dimmed.
- ☐ Prev / Next buttons move the step and scroll the matching narration into view.
- ☐ Reduced motion: stepping snaps instead of smooth-scrolling; nothing breaks.

**`Token` motif (`/dev/token`)**
- ☐ All states legible and distinct: default / active (warm) / inert (cool) / ghost / with-id.
- ☐ Weight ramp reads inert → amber → coral as weight rises (cool to hot).
- ☐ Interactive row: click selects; focus + ← / → moves selection; selected ring is clear.

**`DeeperBlock` (Part 1, "The attention score")**
- ☐ Collapsed by default; expands on click/Enter; the KaTeX formula renders correctly
  (fraction bar, √, superscript), not as raw `$…$`.

**Cross-cutting**
- ☐ No console errors on any route.
- ☐ Keyboard: every control reachable and operable; visible focus ring everywhere.

## M1 — Attention fan (`/dev/attention`)

- ☐ Do the three heads show *distinct, sensible* patterns? Switching head should visibly
  change the fan: "Previous token" (weight on the prior token), a structured/content head,
  and a broad/diffuse head.
- ☐ Is high attention clearly **warmer and thicker** (cool→amber→coral, thin→thick)?
- ☐ Click a token → fan re-roots to it. Focus a token + ←/→ → query moves. Feels right?
- ☐ Hovering/focusing a key token surfaces its numeric weight (readout + tooltip).
- ☐ Reduced motion: re-fan is instant (no line tween).

## M2 — Float exploder (`/dev/float`)

- ☐ Toggling any bit updates the represented value live (try flipping the sign, an exponent
  bit, a mantissa bit).
- ☐ Sign / exponent / mantissa fields are visually delineated and match the format
  (FP32 1/8/23, FP16 1/5/10, BF16 1/8/7).
- ☐ Switch FP16 ↔ BF16 on the same value: BF16 keeps the range but shows fewer mantissa bits —
  does that read clearly?
- ☐ Presets load (0.1, 1/3, max-normal, smallest-subnormal); Infinity/NaN/subnormal labels show.

## M2 — Quantization slider (`/dev/quant`)

- ☐ Does the histogram visibly **stair-step** into discrete levels as precision drops
  FP16 → INT8 → Q4 → Q2?
- ☐ Model-size (GB) and the quality score update live; is the quality clearly labeled
  *illustrative / not a benchmark*? Are the numbers believable (e.g. 7B Q4 ≈ 3.5 GB)?
- ☐ Precision + param-count selectors keyboard-operable; reduced motion snaps without tween.
- ⚠ Known (M9): the precision/param radiogroups are Tab-focusable but lack roving-tabindex
  arrow-key navigation — still operable, refine in the a11y pass.

## M3 — Prefill / decode + KV cache (`/dev/prefill`)

- ☐ Is the parallel-prefill vs token-by-token-decode distinction obvious? Are the
  **compute-bound** (prefill) / **memory-bound** (decode) labels present and placed sensibly?
- ☐ Does the KV-cache grid fill **cell-by-cell** during decode?
- ☐ "No cache" toggle: does the redundant recompute feel wasteful, and does the step counter
  grow ~O(n²) vs ~O(n) cached?
- ☐ Context-length slider + preset switch update the KV-memory readout; does GQA visibly
  shrink the KV vs MHA?
- ☐ Play/Pause works; reduced motion gives a stepped static fallback that still teaches.
- ⚠ Known (M9): in "no cache" mode the recompute is a static re-tint rather than a per-step pulse.

## M4 — Part 1: The transformer (`/`, the Part 1 section, + `/dev/*`)

Read Part 1 top-to-bottom in the page; exercise each visual in isolation at the `/dev` slug noted.

- ☐ **Reads as one descent:** tokenization → embeddings → the stack → attention → Q/K/V →
  FFN/MoE → logits→token → autoregression. Does each beat flow into the next? Do the
  `DeeperBlock` math asides (attention eq., RMSNorm, 2-D caveat) render as real KaTeX?
- ☐ **Two-column beats (desktop):** is the prose paired with its visual side-by-side, and does
  the visual stay **sticky** in view while you read the related text? Do the wide beats
  (attention, Q/K/V, sampling) break to full width sensibly? Does it **stack cleanly on mobile**?
- ☐ Do the interactives keep their own styling inside the figures (no prose color/spacing leaking
  into readouts/labels)?
- ☐ **Tokenizer** (`/dev/tokenizer`): edit the text — do tokens/ids update live? Do compound
  words visibly split into subwords? Do the four kinds (word/subword/punct/space) read clearly?
- ☐ **EmbeddingSpace** (`/dev/embeddings`): are the 5 clusters visually separated? Click a word —
  do its nearest neighbors highlight? Does the analogy overlay (king − man + woman → queen) land?
- ☐ **TransformerStack** (`/dev/stack`): is the pre-norm layer legible (norm → attn → FFN with
  residual arrows)? Does the FFN read as "holds most params"? Do presets change the numbers?
- ☐ **AttentionFan** (`/dev/attention`): still the centerpiece — heads distinct, warm=strong.
- ☐ **QKVMultiHead** (`/dev/qkv`): does Q·Kᵀ → softmax → weighted-V read step-by-step? Do heads
  differ? Does the GQA/MQA toggle visibly share K/V (and the copy now reads sensibly at 1×)?
- ☐ **MoERouter** (`/dev/moe`): do only the top-k experts light up (rest dormant)? Is the
  active-vs-total readout believable (~5 B of ~117 B)?
- ☐ **SamplingPlayground** (`/dev/sampling`): do temperature / top-k / top-p visibly reshape the
  bars? Are filtered-out tokens greyed? Does "Sample" pick sensibly?
- ☐ **Autoregression** (`/dev/autoregression`): does the context grow one token at a time with a
  feedback loop? Does the KV-cache motivation note land? Play/pause + reduced-motion stepped work?
- ⚠ Known minors (M9 polish, non-blocking): embeddings selection follows focus while tabbing;
  sampling's drawn-token readout lacks `aria-live`; autoregression's emitted token is shown
  persistently rather than as a brief flash. None affect correctness.

## M5 — Part 2: Weights as numbers (`/`, the Part 2 section, + `/dev/*`)

- ☐ **Reads as one descent:** zoom into a weight → floating point → quantization → block scaling
  → memory budget → distillation. Does the "it's all just numbers" framing land and flow into
  how they're stored, then how much room they take?
- ☐ **ZoomToWeight** (`/dev/zoom`): does zooming model → layer → matrix → one float feel like a
  real zoom? Are the matrix cells colored by value, the single weight legible (with its bits)?
- ☐ **FloatExploder** / **QuantizationSlider** (the M2 signature pieces) read well *in prose* now?
- ☐ **BlockScaling** (`/dev/blockscale`): does toggling per-tensor → per-block visibly **collapse
  the error**? Is "real blocks are 32" labeled? Does the MXFP4 `DeeperBlock` (E2M1 / E8M0) render?
- ☐ **MemoryBudget** (`/dev/budget`): does the stacked weights+KV bar vs the VRAM marker make
  "fits / doesn't fit" obvious? Are the numbers believable (7B FP16 = 14 GB, Q4 = 3.5 GB)? Is the
  `size_B × 0.6 ≈ Q4 GB` rule shown?
- ☐ **Distillation** (`/dev/distill`): is the teacher → traces → student transfer clear, and
  distinct from quantization? Is the transfer score labeled illustrative?
- ⚠ Known minors (M9): budget/blockscale radiogroups lack roving-tabindex arrow nav; zoom's big
  decimal and its FP16 bits differ by ~6e-5 (illustrative); extreme over-capacity bar can clip.

## M6 — Part 3: Inference, software (`/`, the Part 3 section, + `/dev/*`)

- ☐ **Reads as one descent:** prefill vs decode → batching → PagedAttention → engines →
  speculative decoding. Does the "engine = memory manager + scheduler" framing land?
- ☐ **PrefillDecode** (the M3 piece, now in prose): parallel prefill vs token-by-token decode,
  KV grid, no-cache toggle, compute/memory-bound labels — reads well in context?
- ☐ **BatchingTimeline** (`/dev/batching`): does continuous vs static visibly raise utilization?
  Are idle slots obvious? (Known M9: under reduced motion the Step buttons are inert.)
- ☐ **PagedAttention** (`/dev/paged`): does contiguous → paged collapse the wasted blocks? Does
  the block table map logical → physical clearly? Does the shared-prefix case share blocks?
- ☐ **EnginesOverview** (`/dev/engines`): are the four engines' personalities clear and correct
  (llama.cpp portable / vLLM multi-user / SGLang prefix / TensorRT-LLM throughput)?
- ☐ **SpeculativeDecoding** (`/dev/speculative`): does the acceptance-rate slider move the
  speedup sensibly (and dip below 1× when the draft is too costly / α too low)? Does the
  DeeperBlock formula render?
- ⚠ Cross-cutting (Playwright audit follow-up): several viz buttons use `focus-visible:outline-none`
  which can hide the keyboard focus ring — to be swept in the polish pass.

## M7 — Part 4: Inference, hardware (`/`, the Part 4 section, + `/dev/*`)

- ☐ **Reads as one descent:** the GPU → GEMM tiling → FlashAttention → roofline → parallelism,
  closing on the "tokens/s ≈ bandwidth ÷ bytes-per-token" law that ties back to Parts 2–3. Do the
  online-softmax and roofline `DeeperBlock`s render?
- ☐ **GpuFloorplan** (`/dev/gpu`): is the SM/tensor-core die + memory pyramid (HBM 80 GB·1× →
  SRAM 228 KB·20× → registers) legible? Does selecting a tier read out its size/speed?
- ☐ **GemmTiling** (`/dev/gemm`): does selecting a tile highlight its A row-strip + B col-strip?
  Does the reuse / arithmetic-intensity readout rise with tile size? FP16/FP8/FP4 selector?
- ☐ **FlashAttention** (`/dev/flash`): does naive (n×n in HBM, O(n²)) vs fused (streamed, online
  softmax, O(n)) read clearly? Does the seq-length slider widen the HBM-traffic gap (16.9× shown)?
- ☐ **Roofline** (`/dev/roofline`, signature): does dragging batch size slide the decode point up
  the memory roof toward the ridge? Are prefill (compute-bound) / decode (memory-bound) clear, and
  the readouts (AI, attainable, bottleneck) correct? ⚠ (minor) y-axis tick labels are a touch clipped.
- ☐ **Parallelism** (`/dev/parallelism`): do TP (all-reduce) / PP (bubble shrinks with microbatches)
  / EP (all-to-all) each draw the split + comms clearly?

## M8 — Part 0 hook + Part 5 synthesis (`/`, the bookend sections, + `/dev/*`)

The bookends: Part 0 opens with the question, Part 5 replays the whole answer. Read the page
top (hero → Part 0) and bottom (Part 5) and confirm the descent now has a real opening and close.

**Part 0 — the hook (`/`, top of page)**
- ☐ Does the opening land emotionally — "it felt like the machine understood you… what actually
  happened is stranger, and more mechanical"? Does it set up the single question the whole site
  answers (*given everything so far, what comes next?*)?
- ☐ **PromptHook** (`/dev/hook`): pick each prompt (capital of France / 2+2= / Once upon a /
  fibonacci / sky) → does "Predict the next token →" reveal a *sensible* top token (Paris / 4 / …)
  and a candidate distribution? Does the temperature slider visibly reshape the candidate bars?
- ☐ Does the planted question ("how did it pick that token? Everything below is the answer.") make
  you want to scroll down? Does "Follow it down. This is a descent." hand off into Part 1?

**Part 5 — the synthesis (`/`, bottom of page)**
- ☐ **FullStackReplay** (`/dev/replay`, signature): does Play (or Step ↓) walk one token DOWN the
  full column — tokenize → embed → attention → FFN/MoE → logits → sample → quantized weights →
  prefill/decode → tensor cores & bandwidth → next token? Is the active stage tinted with its
  **part accent** (purple model / amber neutral / teal hardware) and showing its recap, done stages
  lit, upcoming dimmed? Does the emitted-token reveal land at the bottom?
- ☐ **ConfigSandbox** (`/dev/config`, capstone): pick model × precision × GPU + context/batch
  sliders → does the VRAM bar show fits/doesn't-fit against the card's capacity, and the readouts
  (weights GB, KV GB, tok/s) update believably? Does **MoE "fly"** (120B at ~5B active reads far
  fewer bytes/token → high tok/s despite not fitting)? Does lower precision raise tok/s? Does the
  "decode tape" reflect *bytes read per token*?
- ☐ Does the closing ("just bandwidth and arithmetic… fast enough to feel like thought… now you
  can see the whole climb") pay off the opening hook?
- ☐ Reduced motion: replay autoplay off (Step ↓ only); both sandboxes still teach statically.
